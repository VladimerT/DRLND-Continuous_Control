# Project 2: Continuous_Control

**Note: This is for project submission for the Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree program.**

## The Environment

For this project, you will work with the [Reacher](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#reacher) environment.

In this environment, a double-jointed arm can move to target locations. A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of your agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.

The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.

## Solving the Environment

**Option 1: Solve the First Version**

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agent must get an average score of +30 over 100 consecutive episodes.

**Option 2: Solve the Second Version**

The barrier for solving the second version of the environment is slightly different, to take into account the presence of many agents. In particular, your agents must get an average score of +30 (over 100 consecutive episodes, and over all agents). Specifically,

- After each episode, we add up the rewards that each agent received (without discounting), to get a score for each agent. This yields 20 (potentially different) scores. We then take the average of these 20 scores.

- This yields an average score for each episode (where the average is over all 20 agents).

As an example, consider the plot below, where we have plotted the average score (over all 20 agents) obtained with each episode.

_(For Windows users)_ Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

_(For AWS)_ If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Linux_NoVis.zip) (version 1) or [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/Reacher_Linux_NoVis.zip) (version 2) to obtain the "headless" version of the environment. You will not be able to watch the agent without enabling a virtual screen, but you will be able to train the agent. _(To watch the agent, you should follow the instructions to [enable a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md), and then download the environment for the Linux operating system above.)_


## Future improvement tips

Even Udacity's benchmark solution encountered case when due to rapid updates to the agent and critic the system trains fast but it is unstable and crashes later on. Sometimes after reaching the high performance and sometimes just bearly mediocre. One case that I had experienced was when I was training the system on a single agent, and an average score for the last 100 episodes reached 29.45 (30 was required to declare that the agent resolved the environment), and after that, it went unstable start to perform poorly.  It there was case of a code laughing at your face this was it. 

Udacity provides the suggestion on how to combat the given situation. They suggest using gradient clipping when training the critic network. They even provide the snippet of the code. 

```python
self.critic_optimizer.zero_grad()
critic_loss.backward()
torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_norm(self.critic_local.parameters(), 1)
self.critic_optimizer.step()
```

Another suggestion is to save based on the maximum average value for the last 10 instead of 100. Use the different name in order to distinguish which networks are which ones that are saved based on the last 100 episode performance or the last 10 episode performance. In this way you even if it goes unstable you will still have the one that performed best in a reasonable amount of episodes.
